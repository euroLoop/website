						<h2>About us</h2>
						<p>EuroLoop was formed by a group of rLoop members, who recently won the Innovation award at the first SpaceX Hyperloop Pod competition.</p>
					</header>
						<p>The goal of euroLoop is to acquire the technical expertise, funding and permits required to construct a fully operational European Hyperloop network for passengers and cargo. We believe Hyperloop technology will rapidly, and permanently, transform the European social and economic landscape, to the benefit of all it's people and companies.</p>
		                <p>We are currently in the process of funding and designing a 5km full-scale test track near Krakow, Poland.</p>
		                <p>If you or your organization are willing and able to contribute to this project, in any way, please contact us at joakim@euroloop.tech<br>

						<h2>Hyperloop</h2>
						<p>The future of transportation is arriving.</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						The Hyperloop concept takes the best bits from 3 previous modes of transportation - automotive, air, and rail - combines them, and removes the bad parts. It will have the safety and speed of aircraft, capacity of trains, but with the flexibility of cars. All while remaining low-cost, hassle-free and with a small geographical footprint. It can also, unlike some previous modes, be constructed to look beautiful and to be almost completely silent.
					</p>
					<div class="row">
						<section class="feature 6u 12u$(small)">
							<img class="image fit" src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" />
							<h3 class="title">City-center to city-center</h3>
							<p>The Hyperloop is silent and has a much smaller geographical footprint than an airport. This means a terminal can be constructed in the middle of a city
							without the noise and space needed for aviation.</p>
						</section>
						<section class="feature 6u$ 12u$(small)">
							<img class="image fit" src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" />
							<h3 class="title">Faster, cheaper logistics</h3>
							<p>The euroLoop system will be desiged from the ground up to handle intermodal container logistics. It can change entirely how container terminals at seaports are constructed, making them both cheaper and with greater capacity.</p>
						</section>
						<section class="feature 6u 12u$(small)">
							<img class="image fit" src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" />
							<h3 class="title">Making your world bigger</h3>
							<p>With greatly reduced travel times and city-center to city-center capability, the Hyperloop can greatly increase the area where people can commute to work from their home.</p>
						</section>
						<section class="feature 6u$ 12u$(small)">
							<img class="image fit" src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" />
							<h3 class="title">Carbon free</h3>
							<p>The Hyperloop is 100% electric. When coupled with renerable energy generation it can be entirely carbon free. It will also have a smaller impact on the landscape where it is build since the tube is contructed on pylons rather than dug into the ground.</p>
